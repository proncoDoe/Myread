## Development server
 - Instructions

1. Fork the files in this repository
2. cd into the directory
3. npm install or yarn install to install dependencies.

Run with the the following command: `npm start`
- Then it can be viewed in the browser at [http://localhost:3000]
- The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Important
The backend API is built by Udacity and **only a fixed set of search terms are supported.** Supported search terms can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the API.
